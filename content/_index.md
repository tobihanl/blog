Hi, I'm Tobi.
I’m a software engineer who loves building real products end-to-end, from data modeling and backend systems to
thoughtful user experiences and the developer tooling behind them.

For the past two years, I’ve been working on AI systems at Rilla, building the pipeline that processes millions of
offline sales conversations and the LLM-powered tools that analyze them.

I’ve learned a lot from reading the blogs of great engineers like [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)
and [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/), and this blog is my way of sharing some of the things I’ve picked up
along the way.

When I’m not coding (or reading about coding), I’m probably climbing, skiing, surfing, or watching Formula 1.
